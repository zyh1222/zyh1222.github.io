Visual analytics supports data analysis tasks within complex domain problems. However, due to the richness of data types, visual designs, and interaction designs, users need to recall and process a significant amount of information when they visually analyze data. These challenges emphasize the need for more intelligent visual analytics methods. Large language models have demonstrated the ability to interpret various forms of textual data, offering the potential to facilitate intelligent support for visual analytics. We propose LEVA, a framework that uses large language models to enhance usersâ€™ VA workflows at multiple stages: onboarding, exploration, and summarization. To support onboarding, we use large language models to interpret visualization designs and view relationships based on system specifications. For exploration, we use large language models to recommend insights based on the analysis of system status and data to facilitate mixed-initiative exploration. For summarization, we present a selective reporting strategy to retrace analysis history through a stream visualization and generate insight reports with the help of large language models. We demonstrate how LEVA can be integrated into existing visual analytics systems. Two usage scenarios and a user study suggest that LEVA effectively aids users in conducting visual analytics.
