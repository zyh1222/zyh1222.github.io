Profiling data by plotting distributions and analyzing summary statistics is a
critical step throughout data analysis. Currently, this process is manual and
tedious since analysts must write extra code to examine their data after every
transformation. This inefficiency may lead to data scientists profiling their
data infrequently, rather than after each transformation, making it easy for
them to miss important errors or insights. We propose continuous data profiling
as a process that allows analysts to immediately see interactive visual
summaries of their data throughout their data analysis to facilitate fast and
thorough analysis. Our system, AutoProfiler, presents three ways to support
continuous data profiling: (1) it automatically displays data distributions and
summary statistics to facilitate data comprehension; (2) it is live, so
visualizations are always accessible and update automatically as the data
updates; (3) it supports follow up analysis and documentation by authoring code
for the user in the notebook. In a user study with 16 participants, we evaluate
two versions of our system that integrate different levels of automation: both
automatically show data profiles and facilitate code authoring, however, one
version updates reactively ("live") and the other updates only on demand
("dead"). We find that both tools, dead or alive, facilitate insight discovery
with 91% of user-generated insights originating from the tools rather than
manual profiling code written by users. Participants found live updates
intuitive and felt it helped them verify their transformations while those with
on-demand profiles liked the ability to look at past visualizations. We also
present a longitudinal case study on how AutoProfiler helped domain scientists
find serendipitous insights about their data through automatic, live data
profiles. Our results have implications for the design of future tools that
offer automated data analysis support.
